### Miscs
I started to learn to play ErHu (one of the most ancient Chinese traditional instruments, Chinese version of Violin) when I was 4 years old, taught by my father.
I was the head of Wenqin National Orchestra of Zhejiang University, where I spent 6 enjoyable and appreciatable years (2015-2021) and made many friends for life.
